### With Trybo you can study:
#### 1. Crystal Structure Analysis (CNA - Common Neighbor Analaysis)
- Distribution of scrytal structures (FCC, HCP, BCC, etc.)
- Temporal evolution of structures
- Spatial distribution of structures in XY, XZ, YZ planes
- Comparison of structures between differentes timesteps

#### 2. Atomic Coordination Analysis
- Statistical distribution of coordination numbers
- Temporal evolution of average coordination
- Spatial mapping of coordination
- Atom classification (perfect, defective, surface)
- Grouping by coordination ranges
- Comparison of coordination between timesteps

#### 3. Wear Debris Analysis (Debris Clusters)
- Evolution of fragment quantity and size
- Distribution of fragment sizes
- 3D visualization of debris clusters
- 2D projections of fragment distributions
- Detailed information on the largest clusters

#### 4. Energy Analysis
- Kinetic energy evolution
- Potential energy evolution
- Total energy evolution
- Min-max ranges for each energy type

#### 5. Hotspot Analysis
- Kinetic energy distribution
- Temporal evolution of hotspots
- Spatial distribution of energy
- Identificaction of hotspot clusters
- Heat maps of hotspot concentration

#### 6. Stress Analysis (von Mises)
- Evolution of average, minimum, and maximum stress
- Stress heat maps in different planes
- Statistical distribution of stress
- Stress comparison between different groups (nanoparticles, planes)
- 3D visualization of stress
- Layer-by-layer stress analysis
